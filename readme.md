Kitty is just a quick console syntax highlighting tool.
It was written for the .NET framework and it shows and syntax highlights source files (when it can). The approach is very simplistic (intentionally) so one shouldn't expect too great things from it, but it can at least help as a quick solution. It's set up in a modular way to support for more languages should not be that hard.
